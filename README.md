# Trivia Web App

This repo is an attempt to make a light trivia game that is playable on desktop and mobile. The interface is intended for multiple choice style questions, allowing for easy play on mobile devices.

The principle build for this is all front end. Essentially, it will be a functional front end trivia game with no substantive database or backend. To be honest, I haven't settled on a method for handling trivia data on the back end.

## First Playable Prototype

The FPP will be pretty basic a feature a a series of questions that the player has to correctly answer. At the end of the round, likely five questions or less, it will summarize the results.

## Current Status

Just started. Woot!
